## Bulldog B.I.T.E.

With the financial and professional support of alumni, Truman State University hosts the annual [Bulldog B.I.T.E.](https://bulldogbite.truman.edu/){target=_blank} Elevator Pitch Competition. The competition allows students to pitch a for-profit or not-for-profit concept by presenting a concept or idea for a product, service, or project.

In the recent Fall 2024 competition, I pitched **M.I.C.** (Mock Interview Companion) which is an online platform that helps user's prepare for job interviews. M.I.C. specifically leverages large language models to create custom tailored mock interview questions based on a user's resume and descriptions of positions they hope to interview for. I won the [first place prize](https://newsletter.truman.edu/article.asp?id=39064){target=_blank} in the competition, and earned an award prize of $3,000.

I look forward to using the money to continue development on M.I.C. and will post any further progress on this site.
